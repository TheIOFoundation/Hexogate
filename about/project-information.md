# Project Information

## About

At The IO Foundation, the Hexogate project (part of TIOF's CrowdShape Initiative), is a groundbreaking model for crowd collaboration, designed to maximize transparency and accountability in NGOs, Open Source projects and other organizations.

By utilizing familiar tools and independent third-party auditing, Hexogate enables technologists and others to launch and manage their own tech-focused NGOs with clear, accountable processes. The platform fosters collaboration, attracts talent and secures financial support, enabling organizations to operate with integrity and achieve their missions effectively.
